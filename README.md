## Why I Chose this Stack and How I Tackled the Problem

I had Chosen Spring Boot because its the perfect choice for a problem that requires a microservice solution. The App exposes the endpoints as required and I have also attached images below, I have used simple naming conventions and tried not to use any existing library to alter the default Java Syntax.
The project has been divided into different parts like Controllers and services to follow the industry standards as asked in the problem.  
The Logging function is added as a service and its automatically initialised and used in the URL service file of the application and a click parameter has also been added as requested.
I have tried to keep the app as Object oriented and as easy to debug and Change as Possible.
Thank You
